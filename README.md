# AM-break_even_tool
A tool to visually display how many 3D printed parts are required to get break-even with injection molding.

## *Created unsing ChartJS and Tailwind with vanilla JS.
The AM break even tool was created to calculate how many 3D printed parts were required to price equal as a small injection molding production.
You  only need to input some data in the form and the chart will update itself, displaying some information on the number of parts recommended, before
having to switch to a injection molding solution.
### This tool was created to be hosted in a Microsoft 365 Sharepoint's Document library
Since I don't know how Sharepoints aspx files actually work, I had to add the styles and logic in the html file.
Also, there are some imrpovements to the UI I may do in the future, so feel free to use this as is.
